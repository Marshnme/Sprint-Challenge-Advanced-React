- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    A functional component is stateless (hooks removed) and a class component can use setState to assign state. also U can get lifecycle methods from class components. 

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    render(): Tell u what JSX will be displaying to page.
    componentDidMount(): Used for API calls listeners ect.
    componentDidUnmount(): A good place to put your cleanup actions. Called just before your component is destroyed. 

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    to reuse code across multiple comoponents.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    to insure they are working correctly. to find bugs ect.
